## **Project Overview**

This repository contains **five shell scripts** designed to explore Linux systems, audit open-source software, analyze logs, and create personalized outputs. The scripts demonstrate key Linux shell concepts including variables, loops, conditional statements, user input, and file management. All scripts are intended to run in a Linux environment (native Linux or WSL on Windows).

## **Scripts Description & Usage**

### **1. System Identity Report (`script1.sh`)**

**Description:**
Generates a system welcome screen with OS distribution, kernel version, logged-in user, home directory, uptime, current date/time, and license information.

**Dependencies:**

* `uname`, `uptime`, `whoami`, `date`

**Step-by-step to run:**

```bash
cd ~/your_scripts_folder
chmod +x script1.sh
./script1.sh
```

---

### **2. FOSS Package Inspector (`script2.sh`)**

**Description:**
Checks if a specified package (like Firefox) is installed, prints version/license info, and provides a brief description of the package’s purpose.

**Dependencies:**

* `dpkg`, `grep`

**Step-by-step to run:**

```bash
cd ~/your_scripts_folder
chmod +x script2.sh
./script2.sh
```

*Optional:* Change the package inside the script by editing the `PACKAGE` variable.

### **3. Disk and Permission Auditor (`script3.sh`)**

**Description:**
Audits important system directories to display permissions, owner, and disk usage. Optionally checks software config directories.

**Dependencies:**

* `ls`, `du`, `awk`, `cut`

**Step-by-step to run:**

```bash
cd ~/your_scripts_folder
chmod +x script3.sh
./script3.sh
```

### **4. Log File Analyzer (`script4.sh`)**

**Description:**
Counts occurrences of a keyword (default = `error`) in a log file and prints a summary. Also prints last 5 matching lines.

**Dependencies:**

* `grep`, `tail`

**Step-by-step to run:**

```bash
cd ~/your_scripts_folder
chmod +x script4.sh
./script4.sh /var/log/syslog error

### **5. Open Source Manifesto Generator (`script5.sh`)**

**Description:**
Asks the user three questions interactively and generates a personalized open-source philosophy paragraph. Saves output to `manifesto_<username>.txt`.

**Step-by-step to run:**

```bash
cd ~/your_scripts_folder
chmod +x script5.sh
./script5.sh
```

## **General Notes**

* **Linux Environment:** Scripts are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 via WSL and native Linux. For Windows users, **copy scripts to `/home/<username>`** for proper permissions.
* **Executable Permission:** Always run `chmod +x <script>.sh` before execution.
* **Optional Screenshots:** Screenshots of script execution can be stored in a `screenshots/` folder for reference.
* **Dependencies:** Most scripts use standard Linux commands (`dpkg`, `grep`, `awk`, `ls`, `du`, `tail`) that are available in most distributions.
